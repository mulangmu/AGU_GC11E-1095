# GC11E-1095 - COULD WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT MEASURES MITIGATE FLOOD RISK IN LANCANG-MEKONG RIVER BASIN?
## Abstract

According to the Greater Mekong Dam Database (GMDD) from WLE (Water, Land and Ecosystems)-Mekong (2017), there are many dams under-constructed and operated in Lancang-Mekong River Basin(LMRB). The active reservoir storage of LMRB in 2025 is expected to be equal to 19% (86.8 km3) of its mean annual discharge from 2% (8.6 km3) in 2008. With these lager storage capacity, and unknown water resources management measures, we could not tell the drought and flood in LMRB was caused by human activities or climate change.This study will focus on water resources management measures, such as dams operational rules, whether it could effectively suppress flood peak and reduce flood frequency on the LMRB? We will simulate these processes and show these results through implement of water resources management measures in the Weather Research and Forecasting Model Hydrological modeling system (WRF-Hydro), which is a widely used land- hydrologic modelling framework, integrating various terrestrial and hydrological processes such as surface runoff, channel flow or lake/reservoir flow. With such simulations, we would understand how the water resources management measures influence the peak time and magnitude of streamflow in both dry and wet seasons and also identify the relative impacts from climate change and human activities on discharge changes. We could find the causes of the discharge changes in LMRB after dams construction.
